=head1 NAME

Lucy::Plan::Schema - User-created specification for an inverted index.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Lucy::Plan::Schema;
    use Lucy::Plan::FullTextType;
    use Lucy::Analysis::PolyAnalyzer;
    
    my $schema = Lucy::Plan::Schema->new;
    my $polyanalyzer = Lucy::Analysis::PolyAnalyzer->new( 
        language => 'en',
    );
    my $type = Lucy::Plan::FullTextType->new(
        analyzer => $polyanalyzer,
    );
    $schema->spec_field( name => 'title',   type => $type );
    $schema->spec_field( name => 'content', type => $type );



=head1 DESCRIPTION

A Schema is a specification which indicates how other entities should
interpret the raw data in an inverted index and interact with it.

Once an actual index has been created using a particular Schema, existing
field definitions may not be changed.  However, it is possible to add new
fields during subsequent indexing sessions.

=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

=head2 new()

    my $schema = Lucy::Plan::Schema->new;

Constructor.  Takes no arguments.





=head1 METHODS

=head2 spec_field( I<[labeled params]> )

Define the behavior of a field by associating it with a FieldType.

If this method has already been called for the supplied
C<< field >>, it will merely test to verify that the supplied
FieldType equals() the existing one.

=over

=item *

B<name> - The name of the field.

=item *

B<type> - A FieldType.

=back

=head2 num_fields()

Return the number of fields currently defined.

=head2 all_fields()

Return all the Schema's field names as an array.

=head2 fetch_type(field)

Return the FieldType for the specified field.  If the field can't be
found, return undef.

=head2 fetch_sim(field)

Return the Similarity for the specified field, or undef if either the
field can't be found or it isn't associated with a Similarity.

=head2 architecture()

Factory method which creates an Architecture object for this index.

=head2 get_architecture()

Return the Schema instance's internal Architecture object.

=head2 get_similarity()

Return the Schema instance's internal Similarity object.



=head1 INHERITANCE

Lucy::Plan::Schema isa L<Lucy::Object::Obj>.
