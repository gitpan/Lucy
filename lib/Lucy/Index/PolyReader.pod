=head1 NAME

Lucy::Index::PolyReader - Multi-segment implementation of IndexReader.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $polyreader = Lucy::Index::IndexReader->open( 
        index => '/path/to/index',
    );
    my $doc_reader = $polyreader->obtain("Lucy::Index::DocReader");
    for my $doc_id ( 1 .. $polyreader->doc_max ) {
        my $doc = $doc_reader->fetch_doc($doc_id);
        print " $doc_id: $doc->{title}\n";
    }



=head1 DESCRIPTION

PolyReader conflates index data from multiple segments.  For instance, if
an index contains three segments with 10 documents each, PolyReader's
doc_max() method will return 30.

Some of PolyReader's L<DataReader|Lucy::Index::DataReader> components
may be less efficient or complete than the single-segment implementations
accessed via L<SegReader|Lucy::Index::SegReader>.







=head1 INHERITANCE

Lucy::Index::PolyReader isa L<Lucy::Index::IndexReader> isa L<Lucy::Index::DataReader> isa L<Lucy::Object::Obj>.
